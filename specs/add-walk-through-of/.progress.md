# Progress: add-walk-through-of

## Original Goal
Let's add a walk through of changes after each phase, something that will be easy to read as the developer, that if I want to deep dive I will just go to the files themselves.

## Status
- Phase: execution
- Started: Quick mode artifact generation
- All spec artifacts generated

## Completed
- research.md - Feasibility analysis complete
- requirements.md - User stories and ACs defined
- design.md - Architecture and integration points specified
- tasks.md - 14 tasks across 5 phases
- [x] 1.1 Update progress.md template with walkthrough section
- [x] 1.2 Add walkthrough generation to research-analyst

## Learnings
- Quick mode enabled - all artifacts auto-generated
- Integration points: 4 agents + 1 template
- Pattern: Each agent gets identical walkthrough section
- Git diff provides accurate change detection
- .progress.md is the central storage for walkthroughs
- Communication style requires tables/bullets over prose

### Verification: 1.3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: POC agent updated
- Status: PASS
- Commands:
  - grep "## Generate Phase Walkthrough": exit 0
  - grep "git diff": exit 0
  - grep "<mandatory>": exit 0
  - grep ".progress.md": exit 0
- All 4 checks passed

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Update progress.md template with walkthrough section
- [x] 1.2 Add walkthrough generation to research-analyst
- [x] 1.3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: POC agent updated
- [x] 2.1 Add walkthrough generation to product-manager
