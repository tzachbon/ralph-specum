# Progress: add-walk-through-of

## Original Goal
Let's add a walk through of changes after each phase, something that will be easy to read as the developer, that if I want to deep dive I will just go to the files themselves.

## Status
- Phase: execution
- Started: Quick mode artifact generation
- All spec artifacts generated

## Completed
- research.md - Feasibility analysis complete
- requirements.md - User stories and ACs defined
- design.md - Architecture and integration points specified
- tasks.md - 14 tasks across 5 phases
- [x] 1.1 Update progress.md template with walkthrough section
- [x] 1.2 Add walkthrough generation to research-analyst

## Learnings
- Quick mode enabled - all artifacts auto-generated
- Integration points: 4 agents + 1 template
- Pattern: Each agent gets identical walkthrough section
- Git diff provides accurate change detection
- .progress.md is the central storage for walkthroughs
- Communication style requires tables/bullets over prose

### Verification: 1.3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: POC agent updated
- Status: PASS
- Commands:
  - grep "## Generate Phase Walkthrough": exit 0
  - grep "git diff": exit 0
  - grep "<mandatory>": exit 0
  - grep ".progress.md": exit 0
- All 4 checks passed

### Verification: 2.4 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: all agents updated
- Status: PASS
- Commands:
  - grep -q "Phase Walkthrough" research-analyst.md: exit 0 (found at lines 48, 75, 78)
  - grep -q "Phase Walkthrough" product-manager.md: exit 0 (found at lines 66, 93, 96)
  - grep -q "Phase Walkthrough" architect-reviewer.md: exit 0 (found at lines 67, 94, 97)
  - grep -q "Phase Walkthrough" task-planner.md: exit 0 (found at lines 159, 186, 189)
- All 4 agents have walkthrough sections

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Update progress.md template with walkthrough section
- [x] 1.2 Add walkthrough generation to research-analyst
- [x] 1.3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: POC agent updated
- [x] 2.1 Add walkthrough generation to product-manager
- [x] 2.2 Add walkthrough generation to architect-reviewer
- [x] 2.3 Add walkthrough generation to task-planner

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Next
Task 5.1 - Create pull request

### Task 4.2 - Create PR and verify CI
- Status: COMPLETE
- PR created: https://github.com/tzachbon/smart-ralph/pull/78
- CI checks:
  - Verify .current-spec not committed: PASS
  - Verify plugin version bump: PASS (after 2.10.0 -> 2.11.0 bump)
  - CodeRabbit: pending (review, not blocking)

### Verification: 3.1 Validate walkthrough format consistency
- Status: PASS
- Checks performed:
  - git diff command present: PASS (all 4 agents)
  - Table format specification: PASS (all 4 agents have identical | File | Change Type | Summary | table)
  - .progress.md reference: PASS (all 4 agents reference ./specs/<spec>/.progress.md)
- Format consistency:
  - "## Generate Phase Walkthrough" header: identical in all agents
  - "### Step 1: Detect Changes" with git diff commands: identical in all agents
  - "### Step 2: Format Walkthrough Table" with markdown table: identical in all agents
  - "### Step 3: Append to .progress.md" instructions: identical in all agents
- Verification command output: "All agents have consistent walkthrough format"

### Verification: 3.2 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: testing complete
- Status: PASS
- Confirmed all checks from 3.1 still pass:
  - All 4 agents have "## Generate Phase Walkthrough" header
  - All 4 agents have "git diff" command for change detection
  - All 4 agents have ".progress.md" reference for storage
  - All 4 agents have identical table format: | File | Change Type | Summary |
  - All 4 agents have Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 subsections
  - progress.md template has Phase Walkthrough section
- Format validation: PASS (all agents consistent)
- Duration: <5s
