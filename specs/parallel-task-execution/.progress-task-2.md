# Progress: Task 1.3 (Parallel Marker Parsing)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.3 [P] Add [P] marker parsing to implement.md

## Learnings
- Added Parallel Task Parsing section to implement.md between Initialize Execution State and Read Context sections
- Parsing logic uses string includes rather than complex regex for simplicity
- [P] marker is only effective when [VERIFY] and [SEQUENTIAL] are NOT present on same line
- Parsed task structure tracks index, description, and three boolean flags

## Changes Made
- `plugins/ralph-specum/commands/implement.md`: Added new section with marker patterns, regex detection, parsed task structure, and parsing logic
