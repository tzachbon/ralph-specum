# Progress: skills-per-capability

## Original Goal
Create individual SKILL.md files for each capability instead of one monolithic file. Each phase (research, requirements, design, tasks, implement) gets its own skill. Command arguments could also be skills to avoid bloating commands.

## Current Phase
All tasks complete

## Generated Artifacts
- research.md (feasibility: High)
- requirements.md (9 user stories, 13 FRs)
- design.md (8 components)
- tasks.md (12 tasks in 4 phases)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1-1.8 Create all 8 skill files
- [x] 1.9 POC Checkpoint
- [x] 2.1 Remove original spec-workflow
- [x] 3.1 Verify skill loading
- [x] 4.1 Final verification (8 SKILL.md files)

## Learnings
- Claude Code skills can be split per capability for focused triggers
- Each skill gets its own directory under skills/
